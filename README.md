# Machine Learning and Physics Exercises (W25/26)

In this repository, you will find all material for the exercises to the Machine Learning and Physics lecture.

## Environment

You can use `requirements.txt` to build the python environment using your preferred package manager. 
We recommend uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). To create a virtual environment and install dependencies, run:

```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also use `conda` or `venv` using the `requirements.txt` file.
